// I don't know how I originally overlooked the controls, but I had to come up with a decision on controls. There will be an automatic mode, and a remote controlled mode. This script is for the remote-controlled mode
// I am not very good at programming in C, I should have gone with C++ or something else to get some features, but I chose C for the hardware functionality. This is not yet functional, and there is lots of room for improvement.
