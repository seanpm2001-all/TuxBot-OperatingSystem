# Movement mode

## For TuxBot

### Low power mode

Wheels or tank tracks - unrealistic, but able to move around with much less power

### Medium power mode

Waddles around instead of wheeling around. You can also adjust the waddle speed. Accessories are not fully accessible in medium power mode (for now)

### High power mode

Waddles around as in medium power mode, but now additionally, Tux can now waddle around while protecting an egg and also control other accessories.
